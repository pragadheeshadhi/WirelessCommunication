This repository contains programs and simulations that explore fundamental and advanced concepts in wireless communication. 
It includes implementations of digital modulation techniques such as ASK, PSK, FSK, QPSK, DPSK, and M-ary modulation, along with error control coding using block and cyclic codes. 
The repository also covers performance analysis of digital communication systems under fading and non-fading channels, wireless path loss computations using indoor and outdoor propagation models, and spectrum analysis of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM).
These programs are designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of key wireless communication techniques and are ideal for students and enthusiasts looking to deepen their knowledge in the field.
